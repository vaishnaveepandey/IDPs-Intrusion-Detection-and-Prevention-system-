## Configuration

1. **Email Alerts**:
   - Open `idps.py` and update the following:
     - `from_email`: Your sender email address.
     - `from_password`: App-specific password for your email account.
     - `alert_email`: The recipient's email address for receiving alerts.
   - Ensure your email provider allows app-specific passwords or SMTP access.

2. **Monitoring Paths**:
   - Define directories to monitor in the `paths` list in `idps.py`.
     Example:
     ```python
     paths = ["./directory_to_monitor"]
     ```

3. **Ignored Patterns**:
   - Specify file patterns to ignore in `ignore_patterns`.
     Example:
     ```python
     ignore_patterns = ["*.tmp", "*.log"]
     ```

4. **Thresholds and Anomaly Detection**:
   - Update thresholds and time windows in `detector.py` for anomaly detection:
     - `threshold`: Minimum number of events to consider.
     - `time_window`: Time window (in seconds) for monitoring events.
     - `train_interval`: Time interval (in seconds) for model retraining.
