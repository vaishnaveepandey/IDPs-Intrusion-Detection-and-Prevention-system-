# Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)

This repository implements an **Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)** designed to monitor file system changes, network connections, and system processes for unusual activities. It includes an advanced anomaly detection mechanism to identify and alert on suspicious events.

## Features

- **File System Monitoring**: Detects file creation, deletion, modification, and movement events.
- **Network Monitoring**: Tracks network connections and logs unusual activities.
- **Process Monitoring**: Monitors system processes for high CPU and memory usage.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Uses machine learning (Isolation Forest) to identify abnormal patterns.
- **Email Alerts**: Sends email notifications for detected anomalies.

## File Structure

### `idps.py`
- **Main script** for setting up and running the IDPS.
- Monitors directories for file events and triggers anomaly detection.
- Sends email alerts for significant events.
- Integrates `monitor.py` and `detector.py` for network, process, and anomaly monitoring.

### `monitor.py`
- Functions for:
  - **Network Monitoring**: Logs new network connections.
  - **Process Monitoring**: Identifies processes exceeding specified CPU or memory thresholds.

### `detector.py`
- Implements the `AdvancedAnomalyDetector` class using an **Isolation Forest**.
- Continuously trains the model on recent events and flags anomalies in real time.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install watchdog scikit-learn psutil
